# React Computer Vision Project

This project is a React application that utilizes TensorFlow.js for implementing computer vision models.

## Features

- Integration of TensorFlow.js for machine learning.
- Real-time image processing and predictions.
- Modular and reusable React components.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed.
- Basic knowledge of React and TensorFlow.js.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd ReactComputerVision
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

1. Load your TensorFlow.js model in the `src/model` directory.
2. Update the model path in the code where the model is loaded.
3. Run the application and interact with the computer vision features.
